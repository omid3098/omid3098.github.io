### Idea:

![Open Flowmap](/assets/img/blog/open-flowmap/open-flowmap.gif)

I was hanging around in Twitter (X) that I saw [this beautiful water](https://twitter.com/nodesandnoodles/status/1686484366103343104) shader in Blender by [@OfNodesAndNoodles](https://twitter.com/nodesandnoodles)
I instantly wanted to make it in Unity.

### Challenge 1:

I've tried many different approaches to make the shader, watched many different tutorials and read many different articles. But they were simply good waters but not the one I wanted.

### Breaking down the problem:

So I've tried to watch more water refences to map the visuals with the shader knowledge I already had, and noticed I need to use a flowmap to direct the flow of the water then add the current water effect I have and move it along the flowmap direction.

### What is a flowmap?

A flowmap is a texture that stores direction only in 2 channels, red and green. almost like the way normal map stores the normal direction of the surface.

Exactely like UV coordinate colors, each color represents a direction.

You can learn more about the flowmap from these sources: [source 1](https://louisgamedev.medium.com/shader-tutorial-flow-map-4410af832a8d), [source 2](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/273421/how-to-use-flowmap-texture-for-rotation-instances), [source 3](https://vfxdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/articles/flowmaps)

### I need a flowmap:

Now how can I create a flowmap in Unity from my current scene? There are some good assets in Asset store like [FluXY](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/fluxy-2-5d-fluid-simulator-203795) by [Virtual Method](https://twitter.com/virtual_method) which provides a really good flow simulation or [FlowmapGenerator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/flowmap-generator-10509) by [Simon Barsky](http://www.superpositiongames.com/). but I wanted to know the logic behind it. So I've tried to make my own flowmap generator.

### Open Flowmap

![Open Flowmap](/assets/img/blog/open-flowmap/open-flowmap2.gif)

After reading many article about the topic, and checking many source codes I have implemented a CPU version of the Navier-Stokes equation in Unity. It will create a 2d simulation of the fluid and will generate a flowmap texture for you.
You can define the size of the simulation, the number of iterations and the speed of the simulation.
