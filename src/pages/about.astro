        After about seven years as a 3D generalist, I wrote a MaxScript that
        automated the entire environment pipeline: unwrap uv2, pack, render and bake lightmap,
        export the level into the engine, all while preserving instances and transforms. The code was messy and far from
        optimized, but it worked. And the moment I watched it process an entire
        level without me touching anything, something clicked. That was the first
        time I felt the satisfaction of programming.

      In games, the most interesting problems live between artists and engineers.
      Broken assets, misconfigured shaders, pipelines that nobody fully
      understands that's where I spend most of my time. I build the tools that
      close that gap so people can get back to the work they actually care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of that, I study the Quran verse by verse, with a framework I
      built called <a href="https://www.omid-saadat.com/quran_reader/" target="_blank">QuranReader</a>,
      sharing what I find on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrcVHXrUupOAAa0D77oXQ9g" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
      in Persian. It requires patience and precision, which is probably why I enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also maintain a few open-source projectsو shaders and tools that started
      as personal experiments and found their audience. My
      <a href="https://github.com/omid3098" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the
      best place to see what I'm working on.
