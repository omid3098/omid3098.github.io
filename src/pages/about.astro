        <p class="about-p">
          I make things simpler for a living. In games, that usually means building
          tools — validators, shader utilities, automation scripts — so artists can
          focus on creating instead of debugging. But it's not just a job thing. If I
          see a process that takes thirty minutes and could take one, I'll probably
          end up writing something about it.

        <p class="about-p">
          I'm currently a Technical Artist at Ubisoft Blue Byte in Düsseldorf, where
          I build pipeline tools and shader utilities for the art team. Before that,
          I worked on various game projects where I kept finding myself in the space
          between art and code.

      <h2>The in-between</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been drawn to the gap between disciplines. In games, that gap
        lives between artists and engineers — and it's where most of the friction
        happens. Broken assets, misconfigured shaders, pipelines that nobody
        understands. I build tools to close that gap.
      </p>

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        I spend my evenings studying the Quran — analyzing it verse by verse
        with a framework I built myself, and sharing what I find. It's the kind
        of project that requires patience and precision, which is probably why I
        enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also maintain a few open-source projects — shaders and tools that started
        as personal experiments and found their audience. My
        <a href="https://github.com/omid3098" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the
        best place to see what I'm working on.

      <p>
        You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/omid3098" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
        or reach out via LinkedIn. I'm always happy to chat about tools, shaders,
        or the space between art and code.
